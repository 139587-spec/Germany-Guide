This is a simple yet effective tour guide website of the Germany. It has many ammenties that allow you to learn a lot about the country or if you are traveling hter, you can gain some knowledge about the tourist and also wha tto expect when traveling there.

This is a project that I make with predominantly HTML and CSS, but it does include various pages such as a travel guide, options for attraction to visit, and a main page to learn about Germany and its culture. I also included a navigation bar which allows you to move swiftly between pages. 

I included recommondation for popular destinations for tourism such as the famous Neuschwanstein Castle and other historically rich places that are highly viewed and visited in Germany. Although there are a lot of detailed recommondations, I also included things to be aware of when you are traveling. I make a list of before-travel necessities, such as preparing your visa and passport for a smooth travel. On top of that, I also added certain things you should know when you get to Germany to avoid awkward interactions! 

There are also lots of images that allows you to really envision the beauty of Germany. I included an image of each of the tourist attractions that were mentioned which allow you to picture the place you will be visiting. I also included an interactive map of Germany for easy access. 

I had so much fun making this project and learned many valuable skills while I working on it. I hope you love it!!
