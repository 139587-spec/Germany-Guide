This is a Tour Guide of Germany that can be useful of you want to travel there, or even just want to learn more about the country. I have included a navigation bar that makes it easy to move around the website. 
There are also 2 main pages, one including places that you must visit if you decide to go, and the other is a general travel guide. There are also lots of interactive CSS add ons that make the website feel
more personal and aesthetic. Hope you love it!
