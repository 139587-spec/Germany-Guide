        Germany is a very diverse country with many cultures and various
        different food varieties. Germany is culturally and economically rich.
        It is most redominantly known for its Berlin capital and many tourist 
        attractions within it. Although it is one country, it is technically
        grouped into 4 parts, North, South, West, and East. Each section has 
        cultural connectivity, but are unique in many factors, such as food 
        and tourist attractions! Although there have been problems in the 
        past with land, Germany has shown a country can survive the harsh 
        times and become one of a kind! The country itself shows perserverance
        and shows people how countries can overcome their differences and live
        in not only harmony, but excel in their fields and create wonderful
        architecture, foods, and culture that has not only brought the country
        together, but millions of tourists from other countries as well!
