            <h1>Travel Guide to Germany</h1>

            <h2>Best Times to Visit</h2>
            <p>
                The best time to visit Germany is during late spring (May and June)
                or early autumn (August to October). Spring brings the blooming 
                flowers which are really pretty to look at as a tourist attraction.
                It also has an overall pleasant temperature which provides a 
                comfortable trip. Autumn also offers many advantages including the 
                vibrant autumn vibes and the famous Oktoberfest in Munich.

            <h2>Travel Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                Most of the visitors are required to have a working passport and 
                designated visa to travel to Germany. It is also important to note
                the flight costs and additional travel fees that come with traveling
                abroad to a location such as Germany. Other that that, there are not 
                not that many specific requirements other than having fun!!

            <h2>Cultural Tips</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be Punctual - Germans value punctuality, and it is important
                    to always go 5 minutes early or atleast on time to all events</li>
                    <li>Carry Cash - In Germany, mostly everyone buys goods with cash,
                    although there are credit cards, it is not that frequent, so 
                    come prepared, or stop at an ATM before shopping!</li>
                    <li>Learn Basic Words - It is helpful to familiarize yourself 
                    with certain commonly used sayings like 'Guten Morgen', 'Danke',
                    and 'Tschüss'. These phrases are very common, so it is important 
                    to know so that you can communicate with other natives!</li>
